What is HTML?
HTML is the heart of the entire web. Whatever content we see online is based on HTML. If you simply right-click on any web page and click on View Source, you will be able to see loads of tags, the first one being <html> which means the document is an HTML file. 

The basic structure of HTML:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Title of the page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <form action="some_action" method="POST">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
What to Expect from HTML Projects?
Along with HTML, you should be able to grasp a bit (or a lot) of CSS and JavaScript. All three technologies go hand in hand, and for the projects below; although you wouldn’t need any prior experience with either CSS or JavaScript. These are simple yet powerful projects that will give you a lot of learning experience.

Features of HTML
Before we get onto projects, let us quickly recap the highlights:

Platform-independent mark-up language.
Easy to use and learn.
No need for any setup or installation.
Links, images, video, audio, animations can be added with little coding.
Not case-sensitive.
Easy to write custom code in other languages and integrate with HTML.
Supported by all browsers.
Free!
Why HTML projects?
Projects are the most practical way to learn any language, and HTML is no exception. To build any website, you need a basic understanding of HTML and if you want interactive custom websites, just knowing the cheat sheet is not enough – you should be able to implement your knowledge practically.

10 Best HTML Projects for Beginners
Let us now take a look at the best HTML projects to enhance your web development skills. 

1. Survey Form
The survey form is one of the most straightforward HTML projects you can start. In this project, we will create a simple survey form and then submit the information captured. You can open any text editor to write your code, and save your file with .html extension. For example, survey.html

You will learn about basic input tags, form creation, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

Here is the source code for the project with the necessary explanations of the tags. You can add elements one by one to see how they work. 

Every file should start with the <html> tag and end with </html> end tag. 


<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!-- This is how HTML comments look like -->
<html>
<!-- the title will appear on the page-->
<head>
<title>Employee Interests Survey</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- as it is a survey form, we will need to submit the details, hence we use form -->
<!-- We can give absolute url, or relative url like /nextpage.jsp, and specify POST or GET method -->
<form action="http://google.co.in">
<!-- If we remove this, every thing will move to the left of the page-->
<div align="center">
